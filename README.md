The Java Queue Application is a console-based program that uses an in-memory queue to manage Task
 objects. Users can interact with the program through a menu-driven interface to:
1. Add a task to the queue.
2. List all tasks currently in the queue.
3. Remove (dequeue) the first task.
4. Exit the application.

This project is organized into three main packages:
model: Contains the Task class.
service: Includes the TaskQueueService for queue operations.
app: Consists of the main QueueApp class for user interaction.
